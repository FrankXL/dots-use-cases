    <abstract>


<t>The DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) effort is intended to provide a
protocol to facilitate interoperability between multivendor DDoS
mitigation solutions and services.  This document presents use cases
which describe the interactions expected between the DOTS components as
well as DOTS messaging exchanges.  The purpose of describing use cases
is to identify the interacting DOTS components, how they collaborate and
what are the types of information to be exchanged.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Currently, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack mitigation
solutions are largely based upon siloed, proprietary communications
schemes which result in vendor lock-in.  As a side-effect, this makes
the configuration, provisioning, operation, and activation of these
solutions a highly manual and often time-consuming process.
Additionally, coordination of multiple DDoS mitigation solutions
simultaneously is fraught with both technical and process- related
hurdles.  This greatly increases operational complexity and often
results in suboptimal DDoS attack mitigation efficacy.</t>

<t>The DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) effort is intended to specify a
protocol that facilitates interoperability between multivendor DDoS
mitigation solutions and ensures more automation in term of mitigation
requests and attack characterization patterns. As DDoS solutions are
broadly heterogeneous among vendors, the primary goal of DOTS is to
provide high-level interaction amongst differeing DDoS solutions, such
as initiating, terminating DDoS mitigation assistance or requesting the
status of a DDoS mitigation.</t>

<t>This document provides use cases to provide inputs for the design of the
DOTS protocol(s) as well as to illustrate the purpose of goals. The use
cases are not limitative and future use cases are expected to emerge as
DOTS is being adopted and evolves.</t>

<section anchor="use-case-1" title="Upstream DDoS Mitigation between an Enterprise Network and  an Upstream Internet Transit Provider">

<t>This use case describes how an enterprise network may take advantage of
a pre-existing relation with its Internet Transit Provider (ITP) in
order to mitigate a DDoS attack targeting its network. As the ITP
provides connectivity to the enterprise network, it is already on the
path of the inbound or outbound traffic of the enterprise network and
well aware of the networking parameters associated to the enterprise
network connectivity.  This eases both the configuration and the
instantiation of a DDoS Mitigation Service. This section considers two
kind of DDoS Mitigation Service between an enterprise network and an
ITP:
* The upstream ITP may instantiate a DDoS Mitigation System (DMS) upon
receiving a request from the enterprise network. This typically
corresponds to the case when the enterprise network is under attack.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>On the other hand, the ITP may also inform the enterprise network is
infected and taking part of a DDoS attack, in which case the upstream
ITP request the enterprise network a DDoS Mitigation to the enterprise
network and the enterprise network is expected to proceed to the DDoS
Mitigation.</t>
</list></t>

<t>In the first scenario, as depicted in Figure 1, an enterprise network
with self-hosted Internet- facing properties such as Web servers,
authoritative DNS servers, and VoIP PBXes has an DMS deployed to protect
those servers and applications from DDoS attacks.  In addition to their
on-premise DDoS defense capability, they have contracted with their
Internet transit provider for DDoS Mitigation Services which threaten to
overwhelm their transit link bandwidth.</t>

    Figure 1: Upstream Internet Transit Provider DDoS Mitigation
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The DMS is configured such that if the incoming Internet traffic volume
exceeds 50% of the provisioned upstream Internet transit link capacity,
the DMS will request DDoS mitigation assistance from the upstream
transit provider.</t>

<t>The requests to trigger, manage, and finalize a DDoS Mitigation between
the enterprise DMS and the ITP is performed using DOTS.  The enterprise
DMS implements a DOTS Client while the ITP implements a DOTS Server
which is integrated with their DMS.</t>

<t>When the enterprise DMS detects an inbound DDoS attack targeting its
servers and applications, it immediately begins a DDoS Mitigation.</t>

<t>During the course of the attack, the inbound traffic volume exceeds the
50% threshold; the DMS DOTS Client signals the DOTS Server on the
upstream ITP to initiate DDoS Mitigation. The DOTS Server signals the
DOTS Client that it can serve this request, and mitigation is initiated
on the ITP network by the DMS.</t>

<t>Over the course of the attack, the DOTS Server of the ITP periodically
informs the DOTS Client on the enterprise DMS mitigation status,
statistics related to DDoS attack traffic mitigation, and related
information.  Once the DDoS attack has ended, the DOTS Server signals
the enterprise DMS DOTS Client that the attack has subsided.</t>

<t>The enterprise DMS then requests the ITP to terminate the  DDoS
Mitigation. The DOTS Server on the ITP receives this request and once
the mitigation has ended, confirms the end of upstream DDoS Mitigation
to the enterprise DMS DOTS Client.</t>

<t>The following is an overview of the DOTS communication model for this
use-case:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>(a) A DDoS attack is initiated against online properties of an
network organization which has deployed a DOTS-Client-capable DMS.</t>
  <t>(b) The DMS detects, classifies, and begins the DDoS Mitigation.</t>
  <t>(c) The DMS determines that its capacity and/or capability to
mitigate the DDoS attack is insufficient, and sends via its DOTS Client
a DOTS DDoS Mitigation request to one or more DOTS Servers
residing on the upstream ITP.</t>
  <t>(d) The DOTS Server which receive the DOTS Mitigation request
determines that they have been configured to honor
requests from the requesting DOTS Client, and honored its DDoS
Mitigation by orchestrating its DMS.</t>
  <t>(e) While the DDoS Mitigation is active, the DOTS Servers
regularly transmit DOTS DDoS Mitigation status updates to the DOTS Client.</t>
  <t>(f) The DOTS Client transmits a DOTS DDoS Mitigation termination
request to the DOTS Server.</t>
  <t>(g) The DOTS Server terminates DDoS Mitigation.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note that communications between the enterprise DOTS Client and the
upstream transit provider DOTS Server may take place in-band within the
main Internet transit link between the enterprise and the ITP;
out-of-band via a separate, dedicated wireline network link utilized
solely for DOTS signaling; or out-of-band via some other form of network
connectivity such as a third-party wireless 4G network link.</t>

<t>Note also that the DOTS Clients that sends the DOTS Mitigation request
may be also triggered by a network admin that manually confirms the
request to the upstream ITP, in which case the request my be sent from
an application such as a web browser in a mobile phone.</t>

<t>Note also that when the enterprise is multihomed and connected to
multiple upstream ITP, each ITP is only able to provide a DDoS
Mitigation Service for the traffic it transits. As a result, the
enterprise network may require to coordinate the various DDoS Mitigation
Services associated to each link.</t>

<t>The current scenario describes the case where the DDoS Target is in the
enterprise network while the DMS is provided by the upstream ITP. An
alternate use case may consider the case where the ITP informs the
enterprise network it is involved into an ongoing attack or that
infected machines have been identified. In this case the DOTS Client and
DOTS Server roles are inverted. The DOTS Client is located in the ITP
network and the DOTS Server is hosted in the enterprise network.  The
enterprise network is then responsible to perform the DDoS Mitigation.
In some case the DDoS Mitigation may be delegated back to the upstream
ITP, as described in this section.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="use-case-2" title="DDoS Mitigation between an Enterprise Network and third party DDoS Mitigation Service rovider">

<t>This use case differs from the previous use case in that the DDoS
Mitigation Service is not provided by an upstream ITP. In other word, as
represented in figure 2, the traffic does not not go through the DDoS
Mitigation Service Provider by default. In order to steer the traffic to
the DDoS Mitigation Service Provider, some network configuration are
required.  As such it may be reserved for large enterprises or large
data centers.</t>

<t>We follow the terminology of section <xref target="use-case-1"/>, however the
Enterprise Network is not limited to the network hosting the DDoS
Target. In fact, it could also be a DDoS Mitigation Service Provider
that has reached it resources capacities an delegate the DDoS Mitigation
to other DDoS Mitigation Service Providers, thus forming an overlay of
DMS.</t>

<t>In this scenario, an Enterprise Network has entered into a pre-arranged
DDoS mitigation assistance agreement with one or more other DDoS
Mitigation Service Providers in order to ensure that sufficient DDoS
mitigation capacity and/or capabilities may be activated in the event
that a given DDoS attack threatens to overwhelm the ability of a given
DMS to mitigate the attack on its own.</t>

<t>The pre-arrangement typically includes the agreement on the mechanisms
used to redirect the traffic to the DDoS Mitigation Service Provider, as
well as the mechanism to to re-inject the traffic back to the Enterprise
Network. Redirection to the DDoS Mitigation Service Provider typically
involves BGP prefix announcement eventually combined with DNS
redirection, while re-injection may be performed via tunneling
mechanisms such as GRE for example. Of course, such mechanisms needs to
be regularly tested ad evaluated.</t>

]]></artwork></figure>

<t>When the Enterprise Network is under attack or at least is reaching its
capacity or ability to mitigate a given DDoS attack traffic, the DOTS
Client sends a DOTS request to the DDoS Mitigation Service Provider to
initiate network traffic diversion - as represented in figure 3 - and
DDoS mitigation activities. Ongoing attack and mitigation status
messages may be passed between the Enterprise Network and the DDoS
Mitigation Service Provider.</t>

<t>Once the requesting Enterprise Network is confident that the DDoS attack
has either ceased or has fallen to levels of traffic/complexity which
they can handle on their own or that it has received a DOTS DDoS
Mitigation request from a downstream Enterprise Network or DDoS
Mitigation Service Provider, the requesting Enterprise Network DOTS
Client sends a DOTS DDoS Mitigation termination requests to the DDoS
Mitigation Service Provider.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="use-case-3" title="DDoS Orchestration">

<t>In this use case, one or more DDoS telemetry systems or monitoring
devices such as a flow telemetry collector monitor a network &#8211;
typically an ISP network.  Upon detection of a DDoS attack, these
telemetry systems alert an orchestrator in charge of coordinating the
various DMS within the domain.  The telemetry systems may be configured
to provide necessary and useful pieces of information, such as a
preliminary analysis of the observation to the orchestrator.</t>

<t>The orchestrator analyses the various information it receives from
specialized equipements, and elaborates one or multiple DDoS mitigation
strategies.  In some case, a manual confirmation may also be required to
choose a proposed strategy or to initiate a DDoS Mitigation.  The DDoS
Mitigation may consist of multiple steps such as configuring the
network, various hardware, or updating already instantiated DDoS
mitigation functions.  In some cases, some specific virtual DDoS
mitigation functions must be instantiated and properly ordered.
Eventually, the coordination of the mitigation may involve external DDoS
resources such as a transit provider or an DDoS Mitigation Service
Provider.</t>

<t>The communications used to trigger a DDoS Mitigation between the
telemetry and monitoring systems and the orchestrator is performed using
DOTS.  The telemetry systems implements a DOTS Client while the
orchestrator implements a DOTS Server.</t>

<t>The communication between a network administrator and the orchestrator
is also performed using DOTS.  The network administrator via its web
interfaces implements a DOTS Client, while the Orchestrator implements a
DOTS Server.</t>

<t>The communication between the Orchestrator and the DDoS mitigation
systems is performed using DOTS.  The Orchestrator implements a DOTS
Client while the DDoS mitigation systems implement a DOTS Server.</t>

<t>The configuration aspects of each DDoS mitigation system, as well as the
instantiations of DDoS mitigation functions or network configuration is
not part of DOTS.  Similarly, the discovery of available DDoS mitigation
functions is not part of DOTS.</t>

<t>Upon receipt of the DOTS mitigation request from the telemetry system,
the Orchestrator responds with an acknowledgment, to avoid
retransmission of the request for mitigation.  The status of the DDoS
mitigation indicates the Orchestrator is in an analyzing phase.  The
Orchestrator begins collecting various information from various
telemetry systems in order to correlate the measurements and provide an
analysis of the event.  Eventually, the Orchestrator may ask additional
information to the telemetry system, however, the collection of these
information is performed outside DOTS.</t>

<t>The orchestrator may be configured to start a DDoS Mitigation upon
approval from a network administrator.  The analysis from the
orchestrator is reported to the network administrator via a web
interface.  If the network administrator decides to start the
mitigation, she orders through her web interface a DOTS Client to send a
request for DDoS mitigation.  This request is expected to be associated
with a context that identifies the DDoS mitigation selected.</t>

<t>Upon receiving the DOTS request for DDoS mitigation from the network
administrator, the orchestrator orchestrates the DDoS mitigation
according to the specified strategy.  Its status indicates the DDoS
mitigation is starting while not effective.</t>

<t>Orchestration of the DDoS mitigation systems works similarly as
described in Section XXX. The Orchestrator indicates with its status
whether the DDoS Mitigation is effective.</t>

<t>When the DDoS mitigation is finished on the DDoS mitigation systems, the
orchestrator indicates to the Telemetry systems as well as to the
network administrator the DDoS mitigation is finished.</t>

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>DOTS is at risk from three primary attacks: DOTS agent impersonation, traffic
injection, and signaling blocking.  The DOTS protocol MUST be designed for
minimal data transfer to address the blocking risk.</t>

<t>Impersonation and traffic injection mitigation can be managed through current
secure communications best practices.  DOTS is not subject to anything new in
this area.  One consideration could be to minimize the security technologies in
use at any one time.  The more needed, the greater the risk of failures coming
from assumptions on one technology providing protection that it does not in the
presence of another technology.</t>

<t>Additional details of DOTS security requirements may be found in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-requirements"></xref>.</t>
